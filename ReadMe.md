# SQL Learning Journey

Welcome to my SQL learning journey! This repository documents my progress and dedication to actively learning SQL. My name is Sara, and I have a passion for data and data analysis. I strongly believe that mastering SQL is crucial for effective data management and analysis, which aligns perfectly with my career goals.


## Projects

Throughout my learning journey, I plan to work on various SQL projects to apply the concepts and techniques I learn. These projects will serve as practical examples of my SQL skills and showcase my ability to solve real-world data problems using SQL. I will create separate repositories for each project and provide links here as they are completed.


Thank you for joining me on my SQL learning journey! Together, we can unlock the power of data through SQL mastery.
